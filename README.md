# Joshua Tidwell - Junior Developer Test Project

This is a simple webpage created to showcase my frontend development skills using only HTML and CSS. The page features static product cards, styled and laid out to demonstrate my ability to design and structure a web page.

## Enhancements with a Frontend Framework

To further enhance this project, I could incorporate a frontend framework like React. This would allow me to dynamically create components for product cards and other UI elements, improving the scalability of the project. By integrating with a backend, product details could be fetched dynamically, allowing for real-time updates and reducing the need for hardcoded content.
